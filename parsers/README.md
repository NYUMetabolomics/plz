# parsers
Parser related repository for all PEG-based parsing used across NYUMetabolomics projects.

The `.py` files other than `actions.py` and `formula_actions.py` are provided only as examples of what should be generated by Canopy](http://canopy.jcoglan.com/). 

To generate them use the following command line: `canopy formula.peg --lang python`

## TODO
- [ ] factor out element data
- [ ] find a way to link from other "client" projects.
- [ ] use an explicit representation of accuracy in elements (e.g. using ints and then dividing into floats as I did in the original skeleton code)
